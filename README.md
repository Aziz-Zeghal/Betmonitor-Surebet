# Oddsportal-surebet
Oddsportal scraper retrieves all arbitrage opportunites for input bookmakers

Current version takes 2 input, bookmaker1 and bookmaker2
No verification is done so put the right names
Scraper.py will return all surebets with both bookmakers
bet type can be 1X2, under/over, etc.

## Todo
  -Optimize surebet container retrival using XPATH
  -For every container, click the calculator button to check if alternatives have bookmaker1 and bookmaker2
  -Function to run 24/7, and check every x seconds the website
  -Telegram notification for new opportunities on selected bookmakers (maybe idk)

## Goal
The purpose of this project is to gain proficiency in using Selenium to scrape website data efficiently and effectively
I plan to apply my knowledge of Selenium in more complex web crawling projects in the future
